## ✅ Entry Criteria Checklist

1. ☐ **Clear Break of Structure (Impulse)**

   * A wide-range candle (or 3+ consecutive candles) decisively breaks a well-defined support/resistance or supply/demand zone.

2. ☐ **Failed-To-Return Base Formation**

   * Price retraces only **partway**, forming a tight 1–3-candle consolidation **above/below** the broken level and **never touching** the original SR.

3. ☐ **Continuation Confirmation**

   * A second impulsive move breaks the recent high (for bullish FTR) or low (for bearish FTR), leaving the base intact as a fresh FTR zone.

4. ☐ **First Time Back (FTB) Entry**

   * Price returns to the FTR zone **for the first time** and shows either:

     * A clean bounce off the zone
     * A lower-timeframe price-action trigger (pin bar, engulfing, inside-bar break)

5. ☐ **Confluence Filters** (optional but recommended)

   * Alignment with higher-timeframe order block or Fibonacci level
   * Overlap with a fair-value gap (imbalance)
   * Located near a session open or news-driven move

## 🛑 Exit Criteria Checklist

1. ☐ **Stop Loss**

   * Placed just beyond the far side of the FTR zone (e.g. a few pips below the base low for longs / above the base high for shorts).

2. ☐ **Take Profit Targets**

   * Target 1: Next logical structure level (prior swing high/low) → partial profit
   * Target 2: Measured‐move or Fibonacci extension → trail remaining position

3. ☐ **Invalidation (Cut-Loss) on Retest Failure**

   * If a retest candle closes decisively beyond the FTR zone, exit immediately.

4. ☐ **Trail & Manage**

   * Move stop-loss to breakeven after +1R
   * Trail stops under higher-lows (for longs) or above lower-highs (for shorts)

## 🚫 Invalidations

* ☐ **Deep Retracement** (Price returns fully or beyond the original SR level → FTR invalid)
* ☐ **Stale Zone** (Consolidation drift or multiple touches before entry → skip trade)
* ☐ **Weak Impulse** (No strong momentum candle → no clear structural break)
* ☐ **Messy Base** (>3 candles, erratic wicks → lacks clean FTR shape)
