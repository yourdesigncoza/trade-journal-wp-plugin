Great, I’ll prepare a detailed guide on the "Failed To Return" (FTR) concept in forex trading. This will cover how to identify FTR on real-world charts, its significance in price action, how it's applied in supply and demand zones, and include statistics and examples where possible.

I’ll let you know when the guide is ready for your review.

# The 'Failed To Return' (FTR) Pattern in Forex Trading: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is a 'Failed To Return' (FTR) Pattern?

In price-action and supply/demand trading, **Failed To Return (FTR)** refers to a specific chart pattern where price breaks through a significant support/resistance or supply/demand level with momentum, makes only a **minor retracement**, and then **continues in the direction of the breakout** without returning to retest the original level. In simple terms, the market **“fails to return”** to the prior level after a breakout. This pattern leaves behind a fresh zone of unfilled orders (an FTR zone) at the base of the shallow pullback. The FTR pattern is considered a **momentum continuation** setup and often signifies that large institutional players drove the move and did **not allow a full retest**, indicating strong order flow in the trend direction.

An FTR typically occurs as follows: **price forcefully engulfs a prior support/resistance level**, establishing a new swing high or low, then **pulls back slightly** (forming a small consolidation or “base”), and finally **pushes beyond the new high/low to continue the trend**. This sequence creates a distinct **zone at the base of the minor retracement** – that zone is the FTR supply or demand area. Because price did not fully return to the original breakout level, the FTR zone is viewed as **significant**; it suggests that **smart money** left buy/sell orders there, anticipating a future retest. Traders value FTR patterns as high-probability setups since they reflect institutional order imbalances and **trend-strength** – in fact, some trading educators rank FTR among the most powerful supply/demand patterns (second only to the Flag Limit in certain methodologies).

**Key Definition:** In summary, an FTR is a pattern where **price breaks a key level but only makes a shallow pullback instead of a deep return**, before resuming the move. The **shallow pullback zone** becomes the FTR zone (a fresh demand zone in an uptrend FTR, or supply zone in a downtrend FTR), often leading to a strong continuation on the first retest.

## Identifying FTR Patterns on Real Charts

Recognizing an FTR in live market conditions requires spotting a **distinct price action sequence**. Below are the visual characteristics and steps to identify a valid FTR pattern:

- **Impulse Break of Structure:** First, there must be a **clear break of a significant support/resistance or prior supply/demand zone**. Look for a **strong impulsive candle or series of candles** that _engulf_ the level, creating a new swing high (in a bullish scenario) or new swing low (in a bearish scenario). This big move indicates a **momentum shift** – for example, price rallies through a resistance (or supply) zone to form a new high, or plunges below support to form a new low. Often the breakout candle is a wide-range **engulfing candle** or otherwise shows **strong momentum (little to no wick)**, signaling heavy institutional involvement.
    
- **Minor Retracement & Base Formation:** After the breakout, instead of a full pullback to the broken level, price only **retraces slightly**, _failing to return_ to the original support/resistance. This small pullback typically forms a **“base” of 1-3 candles** just beyond the broken level. In many cases, the base will appear as a **drop-base-rally** pattern in a bullish FTR or a **rally-base-drop** in a bearish FTR. For example, in a bullish FTR you might see **one or two small bearish candles or dojis** following the breakout surge – this is the base where price paused briefly to “collect orders” before the next leg. The base often sits between the old level and the new high/low, never touching the old level, hence the name _Failed To Return_. This base zone is the nascent **FTR zone**.
    
- **Continuation and Confirmation:** From that base, price then **launches into another impulsive move in the original breakout direction**, breaking the recent swing high or low. This confirms the FTR: the shallow base is left intact as price continues the trend. In a bullish case, the base becomes a **demand FTR zone**, confirmed once price rallies and prints a higher high beyond the one made on the initial breakout. In a bearish case, the base is a **supply FTR zone**, confirmed when price falls and makes a lower low past the initial breakdown point. The FTR zone is essentially the **last consolidation before the continuation**, and it should stand out as a small rectangle of price action that wasn’t revisited during the move.
    

To summarize the **sequence of an ideal FTR**, consider these steps (for a bullish FTR, simply invert for bearish):

1. **Initial S/R Level (First SR) Forms:** There is an established resistance (or supply) level in a down-move, or support in an up-move, acting as the first barrier.
    
2. **Strong Break (Engulf) of First SR:** Price surges and **engulfs the level with a strong bullish candle**, indicating a break of structure.
    
3. **New Level (Second SR) Forms:** After the breakout, price makes a **new swing high** (second SR). This is the peak reached before any retracement.
    
4. **Shallow Pullback & Base:** Price then **pulls back from the second SR**, but crucially **fails to return to the original broken level**. Instead, it **stalls in between**, forming a base (a small range or single opposite-color candle). This un-retouched area is the **FTR zone**.
    
5. **Break of Second SR:** From the base, price **pushes up again and breaks above the recent swing high (second SR)**, resuming the uptrend. This confirms the momentum and solidifies the zone as a valid FTR demand zone.
    

The same logic applies in reverse for a bearish FTR (break of support or demand, minor bounce that fails to reach back to the broken support, then a drop to new lows). Identifying these patterns often involves scanning for a **sharp rally or drop**, a **tiny pause**, and then a **further rally/drop**.

**Candlestick Structure of FTR:** On candlestick charts, an FTR pattern often looks like a brief counter-trend candle (or a couple of candles) interrupting a strong run. Traders note that a bullish FTR frequently presents as “**three or more bullish candles in a row, then one small bearish candle (the FTR candle), then continuation up**,” whereas a bearish FTR might be “several bearish candles, then one small bullish pullback candle, then a further drop”. In other words, the **FTR candle** is the **isolated opposite-color candle** within a strong trend move. This candle (or mini base) represents the moment institutions collected liquidity (buy orders in a downtrend or sell orders in an uptrend) before resuming the move. A large engulfing candle often marks the breakout of the initial level, and another engulfing or strong candle marks the continuation out of the base, so engulfing patterns **sandwich the small base**. This characteristic “engulf-base-engulf” sequence is a hallmark of FTR formations.

**Common Timeframes:** FTR patterns can be found **across multiple timeframes**, but they are most **reliable on higher timeframes** (H1, H4, Daily) where the support/resistance levels and momentum are more significant. Swing traders often spot FTR zones on H4 or Daily charts for major moves, whereas intraday traders may use 15M or 1H charts to find smaller FTR setups. In fact, some guidelines suggest using **M15 or higher for valid FTR/FTB setups** to filter out noise. It’s important to note the **multi-timeframe nature** of FTRs: a huge single candle on a 4H chart might actually contain a drop-base-rally on a 15M chart (a so-called _“hidden FTR”_ on lower timeframe). Traders often zoom into lower timeframes to spot the FTR base that isn’t obvious on the higher timeframe chart. Conversely, always confirm that the level broken was significant on a higher timeframe to ensure the FTR isn’t formed around trivial minor swings. In summary, **higher timeframe FTR zones carry more weight**, but one may need to inspect a timeframe or two lower to precisely identify and draw the base zone. Using a top-down approach – e.g. finding an H4 FTR and refining the base on H1/M15 – is a common practice.

## Market Conditions Best Suited for FTR Setups

FTR patterns tend to be most effective in **strongly trending or momentum-driven market conditions**. Because an FTR is fundamentally a **trend continuation pattern**, it thrives when the market has a clear directional bias:

- **Trending Markets:** An FTR usually marks either the **onset of a new trend or a powerful continuation of an existing trend**. For example, if a currency pair is transitioning from a downtrend to an uptrend, the initial break of a major supply zone with an FTR can signal the trend reversal. Similarly, within an established uptrend, an FTR may appear as the trend pauses briefly before another leg higher. In both cases, the market is **moving directionally with momentum**, which is ideal for FTR. A key advantage noted by educators is that the FTR pattern **“is formed in line with the trend,”** so after it completes, the probability of price continuing in the trend direction is very high. Essentially, FTR confirms that _“the path of least resistance”_ is now the breakout direction.
    
- **High Volatility and Liquidity:** FTRs often occur around periods of high activity – for instance, during **major session opens (London, New York)** or after important economic news – when large orders push price through key levels. Deep liquidity allows big players to drive price and then quickly reverse it for a small retrace. Major FX pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/JPY, etc.) which are highly liquid and prone to sharp moves produce more FTR opportunities simply because they frequently break significant levels on momentum. **Volatile trending pairs** like GBP/JPY or XAU/USD (gold) may form FTR setups regularly as they often exhibit strong thrusts and shallow pullbacks. However, even a typically slower pair like EUR/USD will show FTRs in trending phases (for example, after a breakout from a long consolidation).
    
- **Clean Support/Resistance Levels:** The prerequisite for FTR is a **well-defined level to be broken**. Thus, they work best when the market has clearly respected support or resistance (or prior supply/demand zones) that many traders are watching. The more obvious the level, the more liquidity rests beyond it – which means when it breaks, the move is powerful and the “failure to return” stands out. In choppy or range-bound conditions where levels are constantly violated without follow-through, FTR patterns are less reliable. **Avoid congested markets**: if price is whipsawing back and forth, it’s unlikely to produce the clean break + minor retrace structure that defines FTR.
    
- **Institutional Activity & Liquidity Grabs:** FTR setups align with **“smart money”** tactics – breaking a level to grab liquidity and then swiftly moving away. They often appear when **market makers or institutions manipulate price** around a key level. For example, in an uptrend, big players may spike price above a known resistance (triggering breakout buys and stop-losses of shorts), then **push it down slightly to create a quick liquidity pocket (the FTR base)**, and then launch the next rally. This behavior implies the presence of institutional order flow. Thus, markets with clear institutional footprints (e.g. around option expiries, stop runs, or central bank-driven moves) can produce textbook FTRs. Traders find FTR most useful when they suspect a **stop-hunt or trap has occurred** – the FTR pattern is essentially the chart’s way of showing “they broke the level and didn’t look back for long.”
    

In summary, **strong trends, key levels, and high liquidity** form the fertile ground for FTRs. The pattern is less effective in sideways, low-volatility markets or in messy price action with deep retracements. When used in the right conditions – a trending market with clear breakouts – FTR becomes a powerful tool to **join the dominant trend** at a strategic pullback zone.

## Using FTR in Trade Setups (Entries, Stops, Targets & Confluence)

Once an FTR zone is identified, traders often plan a **First Time Back (FTB)** trade – meaning they will execute a trade on the **first retest** of the new FTR zone. Here’s how FTR-based setups are commonly executed:

**1. Marking the FTR Zone:** After the pattern forms (impulse – base – continuation), draw a **rectangle around the base candles**, encompassing the highest and lowest price of that base. This is your **FTR supply/demand zone**. Typically, it’s drawn to cover the small consolidation or single pullback candle(s). This zone represents where institutions likely placed orders. It’s crucial that the zone is **“fresh” (untouched)** – price should not have revisited it yet. Traders will mark this on their charts and set alerts for when price returns.

**2. Entry on First Retest (FTB):** The ideal entry is when price **comes back to the FTR zone for the very first time** after its formation. This first retest is called **FTB (First Time Back)** and is often the highest probability entry, since the zone still holds unfilled orders and has not been “used up” by prior tests. There are a couple of entry methods:

- **Limit Order Entry:** Some aggressive traders place a pending limit order at or just inside the FTR zone (e.g. at the midpoint or 50% of the zone) to automatically go long/short on the touch. This requires confidence in the zone – typically done if the FTR is very clear and the impulse away was strong.
    
- **Confirmation Entry:** Others prefer to wait for **price action confirmation** upon the retest. This might mean watching a lower timeframe for bullish reversal candles (if it’s a demand FTR) or bearish candles (for a supply FTR) once price dips into the zone. For example, one might wait for a **closing price rejection** – such as a pin bar, engulfing candle, or inside bar break – that signals the zone is holding. A common rule is to wait for one candle to **close inside the FTR zone, and the next candle to close back out in your favor** (this was noted as a confirmation rule in some strategies). This way, you avoid entries if price slices straight through the zone.
    

**3. Stop-Loss Placement:** Risk management is straightforward: the **stop loss should go just beyond the FTR zone**, with a little buffer. For a long trade (demand FTR), the stop is placed a few pips below the FTR base’s low; for a short (supply FTR), a few pips above the base’s high. The idea is that if price decisively breaches the far side of the zone, the FTR has failed and you want out. Because FTR zones tend to be small (due to the minor retracement nature), **stop distances are usually tight**, which is one reason FTR setups can be attractive – they often allow a **favorable risk-to-reward ratio**. For instance, a zone might be only 10 pips tall on a 1H chart; one could place a stop ~5 pips beyond it. This **minimized risk** is a noted advantage of the FTR strategy.

**4. Take-Profit Targets:** Profit targets for FTR trades are commonly set at the next logical **“trouble area”** or opposing zone. Since an FTR trade is a trend-following continuation, you might aim for:

- **The next swing high/low or next supply/demand zone** in the trend direction. For a long, that could be the next resistance above; for a short, the next support below.
    
- **Measured move or Fibonacci extensions:** Some traders use Fibonacci to project targets. For example, they might measure the impulse leg that formed the FTR and project it from the FTR zone forward. Others simply use Fibo retracement of the impulse to set TP (e.g. 100% or 161.8% extension).
    
- **Fixed Risk-Reward:** It’s common to seek at least a **2:1 or 3:1 reward-to-risk** given the high probability nature. In practice, many FTR trades can achieve 3R or more because the stop is tight and if the trend resumes strongly, the move can be significant. For instance, the creator of the HoneyPips example noted a _1:3 R:R_ was readily achieved on the first bounce off a bullish FTR zone.
    

A conservative approach is to **take partial profits at a 1:1 or 2:1 reward, then trail stops** or leave a runner position to ride the trend further, since FTR often marks the beginning of a sustained move.

**5. Additional Confluence Factors:** Successful FTR traders rarely rely on the pattern in isolation – they often **combine FTR zones with other price action concepts** for confirmation:

- _Supply/Demand & Order Blocks:_ An FTR zone usually coincides with a **supply or demand zone** created by the impulse move. In fact, the FTR base **is essentially the same as an institutional order block** – the last consolidation where big orders were filled before the move. If your trading approach includes order blocks, you’ll notice the FTR zone often _is_ the H1/H4 order block post-breakout. This overlap means an FTR trade is reinforced by the idea that institutions have a vested interest in that zone (it’s where they likely accumulated a position). An FTR aligned with a known higher-timeframe order block is particularly potent.
    
- _Imbalances (Fair Value Gaps):_ Strong impulse moves frequently leave behind **price imbalances** (gaps between candle wicks on lower timeframes, often visible as one-sided candles). If a bullish impulse created a **fair value gap (FVG)** just below the FTR demand zone, for example, the first retest might simultaneously **fill that gap** and tap the FTR – a high-probability confluence. The logic is that the market often comes back to “fill” an imbalance, and if that coincides with the FTR zone, there’s a dual reason for a bounce (filled imbalance + institutional zone). Smart Money Concept (ICT) traders explicitly look for **liquidity voids or imbalances lining up with order blocks/FTR zones** as confirmation of strong demand or supply.
    
- _Fib Ratios and Structure:_ Some traders use **Fibonacci retracements** on the impulse leg that precedes the FTR to gauge the pullback’s depth. A very shallow pullback (e.g. 23.6% retracement or less) is characteristic of FTR; often the base sits around the 23–38% retracement level of the impulse. If the FTR zone also aligns with, say, a 50% retracement of a larger swing or with a prior minor swing point, that adds confidence. For instance, one strategy is to ensure the **50% retracement of the impulse and a previous swing high coincide at the FTR zone** for extra confluence.
    
- _Other PA Patterns:_ The FTR zone might overlap with other familiar patterns – e.g. it could form at a **former support-turned-resistance (swap level)** or align with a **trend line**. If, for example, the FTR demand zone sits right at an ascending trendline support or a moving average, those additional supports make the trade more convincing. Essentially, traders **“stack reasons”** to take the trade: the more independent signals pointing to that zone (be it S/R, fib, trendline, divergence, etc.), the better.
    

**6. Trade Management:** Once in a trade, managing it is important. Because FTR trades rely on quick continuation, if price **stalls or closes beyond the zone against you, it’s a warning sign**. Many will cut the trade if an FTR retest candle closes clearly past the zone (invalidating the zone). On the winning side, one may trail the stop under higher-lows (in an uptrend) or above lower-highs as the trend continues. If the pattern performs as expected, the reaction is often swift; lack of a reaction on first touch is a clue that the zone might not hold.

Finally, it’s worth noting that **FTR zones should ideally be traded only the _first time back_**. After an initial FTB trade, if price later returns again (second or third time), the probability of success drops significantly because each touch **consumes more orders** from that zone. The first retest is the freshest; subsequent retests are more likely to break through or produce weaker bounces. Many strategies explicitly say **“if price consolidates before coming back, or if it has already revisited, skip the trade.”** In other words, _one and done_ is the safest approach with FTR zones.

## Statistics and Reliability of FTR Setups on Major Pairs

**How reliable is the FTR pattern, and how often does it occur?** These are important questions for traders looking to incorporate FTR into their strategy. While concrete statistical studies on FTR win rates are scarce (the pattern is somewhat niche and strategy-specific), **anecdotal evidence and backtesting by practitioners suggest that FTR setups can be highly reliable** when properly applied. In fact, some trading educators tout FTR as a **“high win-rate method”** due to its alignment with institutional order flow and trend momentum. Because entries are taken on controlled pullbacks (with tight stops) in the direction of a powerful move, the pattern inherently skews the odds in favor of continuation rather than reversal. One trading academy notes that **the FTR strategy often yields a high success rate** since the trader is effectively “buying a dip in an uptrend or selling a rally in a downtrend” with momentum confirmation, which is a fundamentally sound approach.

That said, actual performance will vary by pair and timeframe. FTRs are not infallible – if the broader market context changes or if the identified level wasn’t truly significant, a supposed FTR zone may fail. Here are some insights regarding frequency and reliability on major forex pairs:

- **Frequency:** On popular pairs like **EUR/USD**, **GBP/USD**, **USD/JPY**, and cross pairs like **GBP/JPY**, one can expect to spot FTR patterns periodically, especially on H1 and H4 charts. During a strong trend phase, a pair might form an FTR setup perhaps **once every few weeks on a given timeframe** – for example, EUR/USD might produce an H4 bullish FTR after an ECB news breakout, or GBP/JPY a bearish FTR on H1 during a rapid sell-off. The exact frequency depends on how often the market makes **a strong break of structure with only a shallow retrace**. Some pairs that trend cleanly (GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY, etc.) may show more FTR opportunities, whereas very choppy pairs (maybe EUR/GBP or range-bound periods of EUR/USD) will show fewer. In summary, **major pairs do exhibit FTR patterns**, but they tend to cluster around significant market moves (you might find multiple FTRs in a sustained trend run, then none during a consolidation period).
    
- **Reliability:** In terms of win rate or success frequency, FTR setups are considered **high-probability** by many price-action traders. One author explicitly stated that _“FTR and FTB ensure the highest probability of success”_ among S&D patterns. This implies that, at least qualitatively, a well-formed FTR has a good chance of holding on the first retest. Some experienced traders report win rates in the neighborhood of **60-70% or higher** for FTR trades when taken with confirmations and in optimal conditions (though your mileage may vary). It’s important to realize that the **reward side** is also favorable – because stops are tight and the ensuing moves can be large, even a 50% win rate can be profitable with FTRs if average winners are larger. A community using an FTR-based system often emphasizes maintaining good R:R and being selective to keep the win rate high. For instance, skipping FTR setups that don’t meet all criteria (weak momentum, unclear level, already retested, etc.) is crucial; those are more likely to fail.
    
- **Major Pair Characteristics:** Some pairs might have nuances. **EUR/USD** often respects support/resistance levels well, so a classic news-driven breakout on EUR/USD that forms an FTR can be very effective (EUR/USD also tends to adhere to technical patterns when volatility kicks in). **GBP/JPY** is known for large moves and retraces; it might form dramatic FTR patterns, but traders need to account for its volatility (perhaps give a slightly wider stop or confirmation). **USD/JPY** can trend for long periods with little retracement, providing textbook FTRs on higher timeframes – e.g., in a strong yen trend, USD/JPY might break a weekly support, pull back only 20% of the move, then continue dropping, forming multiple daily FTR zones on the way down. Generally, **the reliability of FTR is tied more to how clean the trend is rather than the specific currency pair**. If a pair is in a clear fundamentally-driven trend, FTR zones along that trend are likely to work. If the pair is indecisive, forcing an FTR trade is less likely to succeed.
    
- **Backtesting Advice:** Since formal statistics aren’t widely published, it’s advisable for traders to do their own **backtest on historical charts**. Scanning a few years of data on majors and noting each FTR and its outcome can give a sense of frequency and win rate. Many find that FTR setups, when filtered with basic criteria (strong level, strong impulse, first test only, etc.), **perform impressively**. But remember that no pattern is magic – risk management is key, and there will be losses (e.g., during sudden reversals or news that completely changes market direction, even a perfect FTR can fail).
    

In conclusion, the FTR pattern has a **solid track record among price action traders for its high probability and attractive risk/reward**. It appears regularly enough on major pairs to be a viable strategy component, especially for those who trade the higher timeframes or news-driven moves. Still, traders should verify these patterns through personal backtesting and treat any win-rate claims with caution. The true edge comes from combining the FTR concept with sound analysis and discipline.

## The Psychology and Significance Behind FTR Patterns

One reason FTR setups are so powerful is the **psychological and technical story playing out behind the scenes**. An FTR pattern encapsulates a classic smart-money versus retail dynamic: **liquidity grabs, traps, and a shift in market structure** orchestrated by large players. Let’s unpack the significance:

- **Liquidity Grab & Stop Hunt:** When price breaks a well-known support/resistance to form the initial part of an FTR, it often **triggers a wave of orders**. Imagine a resistance level that many traders have been watching – when price surges above it, it **activates breakout buy orders and hits the stop-loss orders of traders who were short** at that level. This surge above resistance is essentially a **liquidity hunt**. Smart money often pushes price to these extremes to _harvest liquidity_. In a bullish FTR scenario, big players induce traders to go long on the breakout (and stop out shorts), only to then **reverse the price briefly**. That brief reversal – the FTR base – can be seen as the market collecting the liquidity that was gathered. In FTR terminology, that single pullback candle is literally described as a **“liquidity grab (order grab) that traps traders”** before price continues. For bearish FTRs, the analogous process happens below support.
    
- **Trapping and Pain & Relief Cycle:** The FTR zone is where many traders get **trapped in the wrong position**. Consider again the bullish FTR: those who bought the breakout find price dipping back toward the broken level. Initially, **“pain”** ensues for these late buyers as their positions go into drawdown during the pullback (they expected price to keep shooting up). Simultaneously, some counter-trend traders might see the breakout as false and pile in short at the first sign of a red candle. The market **manipulates expectations** here – breakout buyers hope for a quick profit but feel pain, while counter-trend sellers feel confident. The term _“manipulation phase”_ is apt: it’s where the market makers want traders in the wrong direction. Now, when price _fails to return_ to the original level (never giving a full retracement), it soon **reverses again upward** from the FTR base. At this point, those trapped traders experience **“relief”** – for the breakout buyers, price is going back up toward their entry, and many will eagerly **close at breakeven** once they get the chance, happy to escape a potential loss. For the counter-trend shorts who jumped in, the renewed rally causes **panic** as they realize they are wrong; their shorts go underwater. Thus on the first return to the FTR zone (the FTB), **a flood of buy orders hits the market**: original longs closing (which means they buy to cover their shorts, if any were short – actually in this context original _buyers closing at breakeven_ would _sell_… let’s clarify both sides): Actually, consider two groups:
    
    - _Group A:_ Breakout **buyers** who endured the pullback. When price comes back to their entry, they **sell to exit** (closing long at breakeven) – this adds sell orders in a _supply_ FTR scenario.
        
    - _Group B:_ Counter-trend **sellers** who shorted the fake-out. As price rises back, they hit their stop losses or bail out, meaning they must **buy to cover** their shorts – adding buy orders.
        
    
    In a **supply FTR zone (bearish FTR)**, Group A’s selling and new short entries create a lot of sell orders, fueling the drop. In a **demand FTR zone (bullish FTR)**, Group B’s covering (buying) plus new longs create a lot of buy orders, fueling the rally. The common theme is that at the FTR retest, **trapped traders’ actions provide fuel for the move**. This explains why FTR bounces often happen so decisively – it’s a short squeeze or long squeeze dynamic. The image below illustrates this psychology for a supply FTR: buyers were “captivated” into longs (green dotted line expectation), then felt pain on the drop, and when price comes back (orange circle) they rush out at breakeven while trend traders and new sellers step in, causing a sharp drop (down green arrow).
    

_Illustration of the smart-money trap underlying an FTR pattern. In this schematic, the **green trendline** shows price breaking out upward (inducing longs), the red line shows the FTR pullback which causes “pain” for those longs, and the subsequent drop from the FTR zone brings “relief” as trapped buyers exit at break-even. The first retest of the FTR (labeled FTB) sees buyers closing and new sellers entering, driving price down. This highlights how **liquidity and trader psychology** are exploited around the FTR zone._

- **Smart Money Footprint:** From a **market structure perspective**, an FTR is a clear sign of a **Break of Structure (BOS)** with institutional follow-through. The initial break of the level is the BOS, telling us the previous trend (or range) has been overpowered. The shallow retrace indicates **institutions did not even allow price to return to retest the BOS level**, because they had so much order flow in the new direction. This is often interpreted as smart money adding to their position: they drive price past a level, then **intentionally **hold it above that level by “absorbing” counter orders in the base** (this concept aligns with so-called _absorption_, where big players absorb the opposite side, preventing a deeper pullback). When price then continues, it confirms a **change in market structure** – e.g., a lower low followed by a lower high that fails to revisit the previous high, then a new lower low, is a structure break to downtrend (that pattern is a bearish FTR). Thus FTR zones often mark **key swing points** in structure (the base is basically a higher low or lower high that forms quickly). They can be viewed as _“mini flip zones”_ where control shifted from weak hands to strong hands.
    
- **Unfilled Orders and Order Blocks:** Technically, the FTR zone’s importance can be tied to the idea of **unfilled orders**. When the price shoots off from that base, not all institutional orders may have been filled (they wanted more volume than they got filled on that tiny retrace). So they leave pending orders there, expecting at some point price might return so they can add more. This is analogous to an **order block** concept in smart money theory. So when price **returns to the FTR zone**, those waiting orders create a reaction – essentially the market says “there’s still business to be done here.” This is why high volume or long-tailed candles often appear at FTR zones on retest (if you have volume data, you might see a volume spike when price hits the zone, confirming the interest there).
    
- **Market Maker Manipulation:** Many FTR practitioners explicitly mention market maker behavior. The idea is that **market makers manipulate traders into the wrong direction at the FTR** formation, then use the **FTB to reverse roles**. Retail traders often lose in these scenarios: they either got stopped out on the initial break or got tricked into a bad trade during the base. Meanwhile, the market makers positioned themselves during that base (either entering in the opposite direction or inducing liquidity). The quick continuation move then **confirms the market maker’s intent**. This pattern of a false sense of security followed by a fast move is something institutional traders exploit. FTR is essentially a **blatant footprint of such exploitation** in the charts.
    

In essence, the FTR pattern is significant because it _visually tells the story of a trap_. It is where **market structure shifts** in favor of those who engineered the move (smart money) and against those who traded emotionally (retail chasing breakouts or reversals). It often aligns with concepts like **change of character (ChoCH)** or **market structure break** in price action terminology – the FTR base can be seen as the pivot where bullishness turns to bearishness or vice versa on a smaller scale, while the broader trend resumes on a larger scale.

By understanding this psychology, a trader gains confidence in why an FTR zone should hold: _if_ it truly is an institutional play, then when price revisits that zone, those same big players have an interest in defending it (either closing prior manipulative trades at break-even or adding in the direction of the new trend). This is why waiting for confirming price action at the zone is wise – if the zone is genuine, you’ll often see a sharp reaction (e.g., an engulfing candle off the zone, signaling those orders executing).

In summary, the FTR pattern’s power lies in the **confluence of technical structure and trader sentiment**. It captures a mini battle where liquidity is taken and the trend is confirmed. Traders who recognize FTRs can effectively step into the shoes of smart money – buying where the crowd is fearful or selling where the crowd is greedy – and align themselves with the **“pain-to-relief” flow** of the market. It’s a window into how institutional traders operate, grabbing liquidity and then pressing the market in their favor. This makes FTR not just a technical pattern, but a narrative of **liquidity and psychology** that, when read correctly, can significantly improve a trader’s edge.

## Examples: Valid vs. Invalid FTR Setups (Annotated Charts)

Let’s solidify the concept with a couple of chart examples – one bullish and one bearish FTR – and discuss what differentiates a valid FTR from an invalid pattern.

_Bullish “Failed to Return” example on a price chart. After a downtrend, price breaks above a **supply zone** (left red box) and forms a **new high** (purple line). It then pulls back slightly, creating a base (highlighted teal zone labeled FTR) without returning to the old supply. Price then rallies and **breaches the new high**, confirming a **demand FTR zone**. The first retest (FTB) of this FTR zone is marked by the left red circle, which produces a strong bullish bounce. A **second time back** (right circle) also sees a reaction but typically weaker – highlighting that the **first retest is the optimal entry**. This bullish FTR setup yielded at least a 3:1 reward-risk on the first bounce in this example._

In the **bullish FTR example above**, note how price action fits the criteria: a solid green impulse candle shattered the prior supply (failed to return to it), a small base of a few candles formed just above that old supply (now new demand), and then an aggressive rally continued upward. When price returned to that teal FTR zone the first time, buyers aggressively stepped in (the circled FTB area), validating the zone. A trader entering at that FTB could place a stop just below the teal zone and target the next resistance above, achieving a high R:R trade. Also evident is that by the **second return**, the bounce was more tepid – a demonstration that once the FTR zone’s orders are mostly filled on the first test, subsequent tests are less reliable. This underscores why one should favor the **first re-test of an FTR** and be cautious on later ones.

_Bearish FTR example (supply FTR). Here, price was in an uptrend and then **broke below a demand level**, making **Low 1**. A modest rally from Low 1 created a base, but price **failed to return** to the original support (it only came up partway). It then dropped to make **Low 2** (a new low), confirming a **supply FTR zone** at the base of that rally (red shaded area labeled “Supply FTR”). The first pullback to this FTR zone (marked “FTB” at the green circle) resulted in a sharp bearish reversal. Traders would short at or inside the zone, with stops just above it. This FTR setup shows how **the broken support turned into a fresh supply** on the minor retracement, and the downtrend resumed from that zone._

In the **bearish FTR example above**, notice the symmetry to the bullish case: price impulsively breaks support (Low 1) with a big red move, retraces only partway up (forming a small supply base), then sells off to a new Low 2. The shaded supply FTR zone marks where sellers accumulated during that shallow retracement. When price “first time back” tested that zone, it dropped hard – indicating that the zone indeed held unfilled sell orders (or attracted new sellers, and trapped late buyers as discussed). A short entry on that FTB could target the recent Low 2 or further, with a stop just above the zone, yielding a profitable short trade. This chart also highlights clear labels (Low 1, Low 2) correlating to the rule: break first low, make new low, shallow pullback, then break new low – a textbook supply FTR.

**Invalid or Low-Quality FTR Scenarios:** Not every break-and-base is a valid FTR. It’s important to distinguish true FTR patterns from look-alikes that lack the proper criteria. Here are a couple of situations where an FTR setup would be considered _invalid or low-probability_:

- **Deep Retracement (Return to Origin):** If price breaks a level but then **retraces all the way back to that same level (or beyond)**, **it is not an FTR**. By definition, FTR means _failed_ to return. A full retest of the breakout level indicates that the market _did_ return and possibly even negated the breakout. For example, if EUR/USD broke through a resistance at 1.1000 to 1.1050, then fell back to 1.1000 before going up again, that would _not_ qualify as a Failed-To-Return pattern – it actually returned. In such cases, the zone is no longer fresh; the revisiting of the level means any institutional orders there have likely been filled or removed. Essentially, a **retracement deeper than the base zone invalidates the FTR**. One should **skip trades where price already touched the origin level** on the pullback.
    
- **Extended Consolidation Before Retest:** If, after the impulse move, price **travels far away and then drifts sideways or forms a long consolidation _before_ coming back to the FTR zone**, the setup becomes less reliable. The best FTB reactions usually occur when price **pulls away strongly (at least some distance, e.g. 10+ pips or a clear swing) and comes back relatively directly**. If instead price meanders, forms a new range, or takes too long to return, the FTR zone may go “stale.” The HoneyPips and ATeenTrader guidelines both mention that if the market **consolidates or hesitates significantly before the FTB, one should consider the setup invalid**. The rationale is that intervening consolidation might have created other zones or allowed partial filling of orders, and the market sentiment might have changed. A valid FTR retest usually comes after a decisive move away (showing the trend’s continuation) and then a relatively straightforward pullback.
    
- **Lack of Momentum or Engulfing:** If the initial break of structure was not a strong momentum move (for instance, price barely peeks above a level and immediately bases), then the pattern is questionable. True FTRs have a **clear impulse leg**. A weak break might indicate insufficient participation by big players, so the “FTR” base might just be part of a larger range instead of a genuine institutional footprint. It’s wise to demand an **engulfing-type break** of the level for an FTR; without it, the edge diminishes.
    
- **Multiple Base Candles or Messy Base:** If the “base” consists of an extensive consolidation (say 5-10 candles) or an irregular shape (e.g. spiky back-and-forth wicks) rather than a tight little pause, it could mean the price actually attempted a deeper retrace but stalled. Some would argue this is more of a small range or a flag, rather than a sharp FTR. While definitions vary, the classic FTR tends to have a **quick, compact base**. A messy base might still work, but it’s something to be cautious about – the cleaner, the better.
    

In practice, when scanning charts, train yourself to ask: _Did price leave and not look back (much)?_ If yes, you likely have an FTR. If it _did_ look back fully, or the context around it is muddled, you’re likely looking at something else. Always remember to verify the context (trend, level significance) to validate the pattern.

In conclusion, the **Failed To Return pattern** is a powerful concept in Forex price action trading. It combines the elements of **momentum, supply/demand zones, and trader psychology** into a single, tradeable setup. By learning to identify FTRs and understand the logic behind them, a trader gains a valuable tool for spotting where the big players have likely shown their hand. Use the detailed guidelines above to practice finding FTRs on historical charts – note how frequently price respects those zones – and incorporate confluences to further **stack the odds in your favor**. As with any strategy, **rigorous backtesting and practice** are advised before risking real capital, but once mastered, FTR trading can provide clear entries, well-defined risk, and high-probability opportunities to ride the same moves that institutional traders engineer. Good trading!
